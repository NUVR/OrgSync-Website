					<h3>How we started</h3>
					<p>Northeastern Virtual Reality was founded to provide virtual and augmented reality experiences at no cost to Northeastern students. We wanted to build an environment in which developers, designers, tinkerers, and the curious could all meet to explore amazing new technologies that are still in their infancy. By providing this rent-free experience, the gap between dreaming about VR and actually doing something with it is closed.</p>

					<h3>Typical meetings</h3>
					<p>A typical meeting at NUVR is structured as such: we meet on Wednesdays at 7:30PM. Upon the arrival of our members, we take the opportunity to discuss the latest news; both the local news on Northeastern's campus (what future events we are planning, how far we are in achieving recognition with the board, etc.) and the news of tech field. We then (anticipate) using the remainder of our scheduled time to demo our latest developments using our tech. Our first purchase goal is a Microsoft Hololens, followed by an Oculus Rift.</p>

							<p>Co-President and founder of NUVR, Peter sought to introduce virtual and augmented reality to the landscape of Northeastern.

							<h6>President</h6>
							<span>CCIS 2020</span>
							<p>Bug-bounty aficionado David Dworken is best known as "the kid who hacked the Pentagon". David is nothing short of an expert in security, with a long history of participating in bug-bounty, capture-the-flag, and other hackathon events (always coming out on top). If you can hear a Suse music remix in the distance, it's likely David.</p>

							<span>COE 2021</span>
							<p>Self-taught expert at absolutely everything, Taha is the quiet mastermind operating behind-the-scenes. When he's not absolutely destroying you in Catan, Taha is probably pushing the boundaries of in-browser shaders and 3D rendering. Or he's building a turtle robot. He's also amazing at origami and piano.</p>
