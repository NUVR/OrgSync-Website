      h3 What is NUVR?
      p The beautiful world of virtual and augmented reality is desperate for developers and engineers. Northeastern University Virtual Reality, or NUVR, is where students from all over campus can come together to research and develop with the newest technologies. Our mission is to provide students and the community at large with a space to explore.
